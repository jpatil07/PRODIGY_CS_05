The program captures network packets and analyzes them in real-time.
It extracts and displays the source and destination IP addresses, protocol used (TCP/UDP), and any payload data present in the packets.
The program runs indefinitely, capturing and displaying information for every packet until you manually stop it (e.g., with Ctrl+C).
